# Moving Reference Frame in Unity 6.2 Demonstration Software

This project functions as a demonstration of the benefit of using kinematic physics principles (forces) to move a character/vehicle around in 3-Dimensional space. This is in opposition to controlling the character/vehicle motion by explicitly setting the 3D position of the character/vehicle. Using physics allows the character to move around normally on a moving platform (such as while inside a large moving vehicle), and their transition between the vehicle and non-moving surface also follows realistic behavior.

This project has a moving reference frame that is a large car. The user is encouraged to move the character around inside or on top of the vehicle while it is moving and also transition between the vehicle and the surface to see these physics principles demonstrated.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download Unity 6.2 Game Engine (via Unity Hub)
2. Download Blender 5.0.
3. Download this entire project folder
4. Open it using Unity Hub GUI
5. Ensure all automatic processes complete.
6. Press the top-center play button. Wait for the software to build.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Use cursor and WASD arrow keys to look and move around. Press and hold SPACEBAR to apply a constant upward force.
2. A moving vehicle is included. It may be landed on, and the character will move on it relative to the vehicle as if the vehicle was stationary.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Unity 6.2 Game Engine (installed via [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download). Currently Unity 6.2 is automatically installed when Unity Hub is first launched). Note that paid licensing may be required if your organization makes more than $200k in profits per year.
* [Blender 5.0](https://www.blender.org/download/). This is a free to use software

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Unity Input System in Unity 6 YouTube Playlist](https://youtu.be/Cd2Erk_bsRY?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0RpLvO3B7aH-ObfcOifMD20)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add in shock systems for large vehicle
* [ ] Add in Remappable controls
* [ ] Redo Terrain Map
* [ ] Add in a UI overlay
